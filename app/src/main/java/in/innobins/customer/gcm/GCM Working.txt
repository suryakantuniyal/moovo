We use RegistrationIntentService.java to register to application server.
******************
1. Registration Intent is invoked from the MainActivity(explicitly) and from InstanceListenerService(implicitly)
2. Server Utilities is used to store any server information
3. InstanceListenerService listens to change in GCM token and on getting any new token it again invokes RegistrationIntent service
4. Gcm Command just provides an interface to different kind of commands that the application can handle
5. Command sub-package defines all different types of command that app can handle and their corresponding handling every command class extends GcmCommand
6. MessageReceiver listens for the incoming messages and instantiates a GcmCommand type class corresponding to the type of message being received.
